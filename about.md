Hi! I'm Dav Clark, and I recently took over stewardship of the Saturday pre-Jam
class in Berkeley. I came to Berkeley with a deep love of Contact Improv, but
had trouble connecting to community. Then, Rosemary and Vitali started this
amazing "FUNdamentals" class and provided me (and others!) a way to connect.
This class is *also* where I met my wife. So, I want to give something back.

Please bear with me as I work to make this and other resources surrounding the
class better. In particular, I'll be replacing stock photos with nifty contact
photos (featuring other people besides me)... I promise! In the meantime, you're
more than welcome to contact me on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/davclark)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davclark).
