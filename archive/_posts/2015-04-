Newcomers to contact are often surprised that we enjoy dancing without music.
But this provides us with an opportunity to listen for all of the rhythms that
are there all the time.

We will start with listening for rhythms within ourselves, using a wall or the
floor for a sounding board. We'll continue with some ideas from Feldenkrais to
be sure we've got a good base of support. Then, we'll progress into some little,
easy rhythms that can transition into lifts.

If you have any questions, please find Dav using the twitter or facebook buttons
