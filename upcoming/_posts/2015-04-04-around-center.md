Where do we find exquisite, effortless balance? Where do we find optimal
skeletal support? I propose that we look for it between "too much" and "too
little." By exploring different forms of gracelessness, we will provide
ourselves with a map to grace.

We will start with a Feldenkraisian exploration, bringing intentional
exploration to the small dance. From there we will explore different forms of
"gracelessness" in inversions, perching, lifts, and flying. We'll also talk a
little about when it's appropriate to try and "do a lift" in a Jam -- some folks
would say "never!"
