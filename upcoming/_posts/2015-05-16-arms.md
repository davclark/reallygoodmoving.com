A standard recommendation to beginners is to avoid the use of the arms. But then
you will often see really good dancers using their arms. So what's right here?

Part of the value of Contact Improv is answering such questions for ourselves,
on our own terms. In this class, we'll start with a Feldenkraisian exploration
of connecting the use of the arms to the use of the trunk. Then, we'll engage in
some short scores where we use our arms in different ways.

We'll work to expand our repertoire of possibility -- in particular our
repertoire of coming safely to the ground!
