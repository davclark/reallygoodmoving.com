I'm thrilled to be offering this material to the Holistic Life Foundation. The
general outline will be as follows, and I plan to post recordings after the
event.

- Brief "3-minute miracle" introducing the way we practice in Awareness Through
  Movement (ATM)
- "Spine like a chain with candelabra arms" -- a gentle ATM on the floor
  exploring the range of movement and degrees of freedom in rotating our
  shoulders
- "Plate Spinner" -- an ATM where we'll explore some challenging coordinations
  of shifting our balance in standing

A general theme will be exploring the alignment of the spine and shoulders.
We'll drop into some yoga in order to track our progress in a familiar pose --
downward-facing dog.
