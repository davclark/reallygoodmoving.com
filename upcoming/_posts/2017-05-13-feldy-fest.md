Please join us for one or all four of our free "Awareness Through Movement"
Lessons (tickets available for a guaranteed place):
- Noon: a chair-based lesson
- 1:15: a gentle lesson lying on mats
- 2:30: a more challenging lesson
- 3:45: shifting levels, spiraling up from the floor

Each lesson will be a guided exploration that can accommodate all types, with
challenges for self-discovery. Teachers will be announced soon! In the case of
overflow, we will lead an additional lesson outdoors, weather permitting.

This event is part of #InternationalFeldenkraisWeek, a coordinated Feldenkrais
Festival, with sister events in DC and Frederick. Please be in touch if you're
interested in participating, either as a teacher or in a supporting role. We
will distribute promotional materials provided by area teachers.
