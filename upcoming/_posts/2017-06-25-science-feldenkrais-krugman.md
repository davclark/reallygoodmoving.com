In naming *Awareness Through Movement*, Feldenkrais makes clear that he's going
after more than just movement. But what is that, exactly? In this workshop, we
will explore experiential and scientific views of awareness and consciousness
-- in particular examining the ways in which those two things are different!

We will explore elements of Michael Krugman's teaching which bear directly on
consciousness -- or the lack of it -- in the action of falling asleep. Along
the way, we'll consider Michael's elaboration on Moshe's model of human action
with his focus on inhibition and selection. We'll also hold these ideas up
against some contemporary theories of human action, including a brief dive into
models of neural computation.

The above will involve some short interactive lecture elements, and we'll
ground each idea in one or more experiences, including a couple of ATMs as well
as trio work exploring the impact of touch on our awareness *and* our
consciousness. Michael never practiced hands-on work as part of his *Sounder
Sleep* practice -- did you ever wonder why? After this workshop, we'll all have
some ideas about this and other questions, and more importantly, how this can
inform our work with our students!
